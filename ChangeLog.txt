ChangeLog

2.0.4.5 
	Updated version file to use github for new version info
	Thanks to github user JonnyOThan for this:
		Fix rendering artifacts with newer versions of deferred + scatterer

2.0.4.4
	Fixed nullrefs due to ApplicationRootPath

2.0.4.3
	Fixed small error in previous fix in path for loading files (broken by new launcher)

2.0.4.2
	Fixed path for loading configs (broken by new launcher)
	Fixed memory leak caused by not removing callbacks

2.0.4.1
	Thanks to user @JonnyOThan for this:
		Use InternalCam for first person
			Certain graphics mods like EVE and Scatterer rely on the localspace camera for drawing effects like clouds and atmosphere when in low orbit. The existing implementation of pulling the camera's near and far planes closer was resulting in those effects getting clipped

2.0.4
	Thanks to user @JonnyOThan for this:
		TTE now works in command chairs

2.0.3.3
	Thanks to JonnyOThan for this:
		store old far plane so it doesn't get progressively shorter

2.0.3.2
	Thanks to JonnyOThan for these fixes:
		hide female heads properly
		camera near/far plane ratio needs to stay consistent 
		Expose near plane distance so other mods can configure it
		bump out the near plane distance a little so that this doesn't limit the far distance so much

==================== Following from release by @Virindi ==========================
2.0.0.2
	-Update for KSP 1.3.

2.0.0.1
	-Oops, found a problem with switching kerbals 5 minutes after releasing. Fixed this.

2.0.0.0
	-A ton of work on making walking, running and swimming more smooth.
	-Reset kerbal's view using the 'v' key when in FP mode.
	-Free rotation and translation added to floating EVA mode. Controls match those used for a vessel. Defaults: ad=yaw, qe=roll, ws=pitch, jl=translate left/right, ik=translate up/down, hn=translate forward/back. A stabilization-mode sas is available.
	-"Fine controls" for RCS packs is by throttle controls while in FP mode. The more throttle, the more pack power. More or less fuel is used as appropriate.
	-Some fixes to stock glitchy behavior for walking kerbals in low-g; prevent getting stuck trying to land on a steep slope, allow the player to break out of a running bound (especially useful for Gilly and Pol). These fixes apply both in first and third person mode.
	-Display the name of the kerbal when switching inside IVA.
	-Navball now functions normally in FP mode, referenced to the kerbal.

1.1.1

	Fixed camera issues after exitting Map view or pressing "Camera Mode" key in 1st person with forceEVA enabled;
	Fixed issues when loading as a kerbal on EVA with forceEVA enabled;
	Fixed switching between crew members with forceIVA enabled;
	Fixed various camera bugs after revert/quickload;
